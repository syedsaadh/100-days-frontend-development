    Problem 5. CSS Grid
    
    Concepts & Theories:
        CSS Grid Layout is a powerful, two-dimensional 
        system that enables the creation of complex layouts. 
        It works by turning an HTML element into a grid container 
        with rows and columns.

    Problem Statement:
        Create a grid layout with 3 columns of equal width and 2 
        rows, and place different colored boxes in each cell.
