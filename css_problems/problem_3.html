    Problem 3. Positioning and Display
    
    Concepts & Theories:
        Positioning and display properties in CSS control 
        how elements are positioned and displayed in the 
        document flow. Key concepts include static, relative, 
        absolute, and fixed positioning, as well as display types 
        like block, inline, and inline-block.

    Problem Statement:
        Create three <div> elements. Set the first to 
        position: relative, the second to position: absolute, 
        and the third to position: fixed. 
        Experiment with the top, right, bottom, and left properties 
        to see how they affect positioning.
