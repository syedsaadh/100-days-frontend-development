    Problem 1. CSS Syntax and Selectors

    Concepts & Theories:
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and 
        layout web pages. Basic syntax consists of selectors 
        (such as elements, classes, and IDs) and declarations 
        (properties and values inside curly braces).

    Problem Statement:
        Create a simple HTML page and use CSS to 
        change the color of all <p> elements to blue and 
        the font size of elements with class .highlight to 20px.
