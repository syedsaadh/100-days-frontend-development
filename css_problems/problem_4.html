    Problem 4. Flexbox
    
    Concepts & Theories:
        Flexbox is a CSS layout model that allows responsive 
        elements within a container to be automatically arranged 
        depending upon screen size. It's great for aligning items 
        vertically or horizontally with ease.

    Problem Statement:
    Create a flex container with three items. 
    Use flexbox to align these items horizontally and 
    vertically centered within the container.
